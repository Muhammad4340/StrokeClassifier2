## Stroke Brain Imaging Classification System

This system is designed for classifying brain imaging data of stroke patients using advanced deep learning technology. The system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the EfficientNetB0 architecture to achieve accurate and efficient image classification.

### Features
- **Deep Learning Technology**: Utilizes CNNs to process and classify brain imaging data.
- **EfficientNetB0**: Incorporates this lightweight yet powerful architecture for high accuracy and computational efficiency.
- **Focus on Stroke Detection**: Tailored specifically to classify brain images of stroke patients.

### Developer Information
- **Developed by**: Muhammad Asyrov Illahi
- **Concentration**: Machine Learning

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- TensorFlow 2.x
